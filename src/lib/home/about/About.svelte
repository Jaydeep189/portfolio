						Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I am glad you are here wanting to know who I am. My grandfather named me
						jaydeep.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am a very curious person, no matter the subject. I like to dive deep into
						understanding the workings of this complex world while admiring it's beauty in chaos.
					</p>
					<p>
						I like building things, there is a certain sense of pride in building something for
						yourself and others. Creating something out of nothingness, making things exist in the
						real world.
					</p>
					<p>
						I like reading literature, philosophy and movies, I like how people just write complex
						things in simple terms, feels that are so complex to express and yet they do it so
						beautifully.
