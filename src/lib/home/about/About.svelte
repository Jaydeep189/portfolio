						Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I am glad you are here wanting to know who I am. My grandfather named me
						jaydeep.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am a very curious person, regardless of the subject. I enjoy diving deep into
						understanding the intricacies of this complex world while appreciating its beauty amidst
						the chaos.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have a passion for building things. There's a certain sense of pride in creating
						something for yourself and others. Transforming nothingness into tangible existence in
						the real world.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also enjoy reading literature, philosophy, and watching movies. I appreciate how
						people can articulate complex ideas in simple terms, expressing intricate emotions that
						are challenging to convey, yet they do so beautifully.
